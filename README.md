### CompTia community advice

- **Engaging in to cybersecurity**: "Not sure if that had stuck if I hadn't been interested in Security long before I started studying for the Sec+. For years I've been watching Blackhat keynotes, reading articles about breaches, I get alerts from NIST, CISA, and Google alerts about breaches and ransomware attacks. I play around with basic pen testing tools, have a home lab, have taken a crap load of Cybrary courses, and so on and so on".

- **Leo Laporte/TWIT and Steve Gibson**: "Leo Laporte/TWIT or even Steve Gibson (although a somewhat hard to follow guy. An obvious high IQ type)"
  
- **Study Materials**: "Study bank by Chapple and seidl, prof dion practice quizzes, Quizlet to memorize port numbers and dojolabs to work on the simulated labs".

- **Things to memorize**: "Immediately write down your notes from the flash cards on the white board. Especially the OSI model and ports, how to calculate ARO, SLE, EF and Cryptography sections. Remember: integrity=hash. And the CIA TRIAD, and AES=ccmp".

- **About multiple choice questions**: "I skipped the PBQ's [at the beginning of the test] like everyone says to".

## Things to Look Into
